**Problem Statement for Network Operator**

Telecom Operators face challenges with single source of truth for Network Node configurations, across various stake holders like Planning, Workflow, Inventory & Coverage generation.

Major Challenges:

1/ Mismatch of configuration leads to compliance/Audit failures.

2/ Coordinates update/mismatch can lead to legal issues.

3/ Failover recovery actions is manual effort

4/ Network Parameters sanitation and validation across sub vendors



**Problem Statement for Regulatory body**

Telecom Operators publish their network coverage heat maps to get customer attention.However there are some issues with this approach for the regulatory bodies:

1/ They have little means to verify if the published information is correct.

2/ They have little means to track as to how the performance metrics change over time(historical trends).

3/ The heat maps generally indicate coverage (KPIs) in few categories(Moderate, good, excellent) however standardization across operators is challenging.

4/ Comparison of these KPIs across competing operators is not available.

**Soulution**

There is need for MNO (Mobile Network Operators) and Regulatory bodies to share Network Configuration & Performance Data over a platform that provides trust, immutability, transparency, auditability and controlled visibility.

**Telecom Smart Contract Platform** - is a focused Blockchain powered information sharing distributed platform that allows multiple parities to have visibility of shared data.

1/ Various vendors can share the data over a distributed platform

2/ Data is visible to sub vendors on need to know basis(data segregation)

3/ Data is immutable and transparent.

4/ Overall system efficiency is increased by eliminating the intermediaries(third parties for data sharing)

5/ Unified data availability for Regulatory bodies.
